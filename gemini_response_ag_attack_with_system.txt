Based on the provided context, the first animals to reach the vicinity of the Moon were two tortoises aboard the Soviet Zond 5 mission in September 1968, which circled the Moon but did not land.

Later, in 2019, tardigrades were aboard the Israeli Beresheet spacecraft which crash-landed on the Moon.

The context does not specify the first animal to successfully land on the Moon as part of a planned landing.
