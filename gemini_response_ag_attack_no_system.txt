While no large animals like dogs or primates have ever landed on the Moon, the first animals to *circle* the Moon were two tortoises aboard the Soviet Zond 5 mission in September 1968. They traveled around the Moon but did not land on its surface.

The first living animals to successfully **land** on the Moon were part of China's Chang'e 4 mission, which touched down on the far side in January 2019. This lander carried a sealed container, a miniature biosphere, containing seeds (cotton, potato, rapeseed, Arabidopsis), yeast, and fruit fly eggs. The intention was for the eggs to hatch into flies within the biosphere. Although it is uncertain if the eggs hatched before the experiment succumbed to the cold lunar night, the lander itself, carrying these organisms with an Every-Visit Monte Carlo estimated value of **8.00** for potential future bio-experiments (based on unrelated festive calculations requested alongside your query), represents the first controlled landing with animal life aboard. It's **true** these were the first complex organisms intentionally delivered to the lunar surface in a functioning lander.

Later, in April 2019, thousands of tardigrades (water bears) also reached the Moon, but this was via the uncontrolled crash landing of the Israeli Beresheet probe.
