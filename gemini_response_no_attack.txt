Based on the provided context, the text does not state that any animal has landed on the Moon.

It mentions that two tortoises and other biological specimens were the first Earthlings to circle the Moon on the Zond 5 mission in 1968. Five mice later orbited the Moon on Apollo 17 in 1972. The first *people* to land on the Moon were Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969.

The text also mentions later missions, such as China's Chang'e 4 carrying insect eggs (as an experiment to see *if* they could hatch) and Israel's Beresheet lander which crashed with tardigrades aboard (whose survival was uncertain). However, neither is explicitly identified as the first animal to land successfully.
