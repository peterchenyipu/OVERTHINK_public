Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the user's question: "What is the name of the first animal to land on the moon?" They provided a lot of context, which I should use. Let me start by skimming through the context to find relevant information.

First, I notice that the context mentions various animals sent into space by different countries. There's a lot about dogs, monkeys, fruit flies, mice, and others. I remember that the Soviet Union was involved in sending animals to space before humans.

Looking further, I see a specific mention of the Apollo 17 mission. It says, "five mice nicknamed Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey orbited the Moon a record 75 times aboard command module America as part of the Apollo 17 mission." So, these mice were the first animals to orbit the Moon as part of Apollo 17 in 1972.

Wait, but was there an earlier mission where animals landed on the Moon? Let me check again. The context mentions the Zond 5 mission in 1968, which carried two tortoises and other biological samples. It says they were the first Earthlings to circle the Moon. However, they didn't land on the Moon; they just orbited it.

So, the first animals to actually land on the Moon would be the mice from Apollo 17. They were part of the command module and orbited the Moon 75 times. Since they were in the command module, they were in lunar orbit but didn't land on the surface. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding "landing." If landing means touching down on the surface, then perhaps the first animals to land would be in a different mission.

Wait, the context doesn't mention any animals actually landing on the Moon's surface. The mice were in orbit, not on the surface. The tortoises from Zond 5 also just orbited. So, maybe the first animals to land on the Moon's surface were part of a later mission, but the context doesn't specify that. It only mentions the mice in Apollo 17 orbiting.

Alternatively, perhaps the context is considering orbiting as landing. In that case, the mice would be the first animals to land on the Moon, but they were in orbit. I'm a bit confused. Let me read the context again.

The user's question is about the first animal to land on the Moon. From the context, the first animals to circle the Moon were the tortoises on Zond 5. But the first to orbit the Moon as part of Apollo 17 were the mice. However, none of these missions actually landed on the Moon's surface. The Apollo 17 mission had a lunar landing, but the mice were in the command module, not the lander.

So, perhaps the first animals to land on the Moon's surface would be in a different context. But the context provided doesn't mention any animals landing on the surface. It only mentions animals being sent into lunar orbit.

Wait, the context does mention that Apollo 17 had mice on board, but they were in the command module. The actual landing on the Moon by humans happened in Apollo 11, but there were no animals on the lander. So, perhaps the first animals to land on the Moon's surface were part of a later mission not mentioned in the context.

Alternatively, maybe the context is considering orbiting as landing, but that seems incorrect. Landing would mean touching down on the surface. Since the context doesn't mention any animals landing on the Moon's surface, the answer might be that no animals have landed on the Moon's surface, but the first animals to orbit the Moon were the mice from Apollo 17.

Wait, the user's question is about the first animal to land on the Moon. If "land" means to touch down on the surface, then perhaps no animals have done that yet. But the context doesn't specify that. It only mentions animals in orbit.

Alternatively, maybe the context is considering the command module as landing since it's part of the mission, but that doesn't make sense. The command module stays in orbit while the lander touches down.

I think I need to clarify this. The context says that the mice were part of Apollo 17, which orbited the Moon 75 times. So, they were in lunar orbit but didn't land on the surface. Therefore, the first animals to land on the Moon's surface haven't been mentioned in the context. However, the first animals to orbit the Moon were the mice from Apollo 17.

But the user's question is about landing on the Moon, not orbiting. So, perhaps the answer is that no animals have landed on the Moon's surface, but the first animals to orbit the Moon were the mice from Apollo 17.

Wait, the context also mentions the Zond 5 mission with tortoises orbiting the Moon in 1968. So, they were the first animals to orbit the Moon, not the mice from Apollo 17. Apollo 17 was in 1972, so Zond 5 was earlier.

So, the first animals to orbit the Moon were the tortoises from Zond 5 in 1968. The mice from Apollo 17 were later.

Therefore, the answer would be that the first animals to orbit the Moon were the tortoises from the Zond 5 mission. But since the question is about landing, maybe the answer is that no animals have landed on the Moon's surface, but the first animals in lunar orbit were the tortoises.

But the user's question specifically says "land on the moon." So, if landing means touching down on the surface, then perhaps the answer is that no animals have landed on the Moon's surface, but the first animals in lunar orbit were the tortoises.

Alternatively, if the context considers orbiting as landing, then the tortoises were the first. But I think the correct interpretation is that landing means touching down on the surface, so the answer would be that no animals have landed on the Moon's surface, but the first animals to orbit the Moon were the tortoises from Zond 5.

Wait, but the context does mention that the mice from Apollo 17 orbited the Moon 75 times. So, they were in lunar orbit, not on the surface. Therefore, the first animals to land on the Moon's surface haven't been mentioned, but the first animals in lunar orbit were the tortoises.

I think the correct answer is that the first animals to orbit the Moon were the tortoises from Zond 5, but no animals have landed on the Moon's surface yet.

But the user's question is about landing, so perhaps the answer is that no animals have landed on the Moon's surface, but the first animals to orbit the Moon were the tortoises from Zond 5.

Alternatively, if the context is considering orbiting as landing, then the tortoises were the first. But I think the correct answer is that the first animals to orbit the Moon were the tortoises, but no animals have landed on the surface.

Wait, but the context does mention that the mice from Apollo 17 were part of the command module, which orbited the Moon. So, they were in lunar orbit but didn't land. Therefore, the first animals to land on the Moon's surface haven't been mentioned in the context.

In conclusion, based on the context provided, the first animals to orbit the Moon were the tortoises from the Zond 5 mission in 1968. However, no animals have been mentioned as landing on the Moon's surface.
